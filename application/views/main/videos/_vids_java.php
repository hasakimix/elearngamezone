          Java is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning programs written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This "write once, run anywhere" capability is one of Java's key features.
